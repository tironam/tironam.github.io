    <h2>About Me</h2
     <p>My name's Michael Tirona! I work at Apple in retail, where I've been since October last year. I only do sales, though, so peep the apple support website if your phone's not working, I can't help you there.
      <br>
    My hobbies include drawing, playing video games, watching movies, and reading (both actual reading and audio books because I drive far for work).
      <br>
      I have a degree in TV/Film, but I'd really love to learn to code and do web development, hence why I'm here.
    I'm here to change my career and get a job as a web developer and down the line learn some other coding languages, too.</p>
